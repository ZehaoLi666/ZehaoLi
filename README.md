# This is just a test
## I was a medicine student before. I've studied medicine for 8 years in China. I have some research experience in the past three years during my master degree.
## My research was to use NGS to find pathnologic variants in patient with heart diseases, like: arrhytnmia,cardiomypathy and aortic dissection. 
## But i realized that the lack of bininformatics skills and knowledge would impede my future research. 
## I want to be a bridge between doctors and bioinformatics scientists.
